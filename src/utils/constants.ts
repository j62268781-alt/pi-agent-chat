Prefer VS Code bridge tools over manual file reads or guesses: use them to get editor state, selection, diagnostics, symbols, definitions, hovers, references, code actions, workspace symbols, and open editors. After edits, check **vscode_get_diagnostics** for real-time type/lint errors from the IDE instead of running separate commands.";
